All human rights are universal and inalienable: The Declaration states that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated (Article 7). This means that all individuals are entitled to the same human rights and freedoms, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or any other status.\\n\\n2. The rights of vulnerable groups are an integral part of human rights: The Declaration emphasizes that the rights of women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and vulnerable and marginalized groups are an inalienable, integral, and indivisible part of human rights and fundamental freedoms (Article 4). This highlights the importance of protecting the rights of these groups, who may be more vulnerable to human rights abuses.\\n\\n3. The enjoyment of human rights must be balanced with corresponding duties: The Declaration states that the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be balanced with the performance of corresponding duties (Article 6). This means that individuals have responsibilities to all other individuals, the community, and society as a whole, and that the exercise of human rights must be subject to certain limitations to ensure the well-being of all.\\n\\n4. Human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner: The Declaration emphasizes that all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Declaration must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis (Article 8). This means that all human rights are of equal importance and must be protected and promoted equally.\\n\\n5. Human rights must be considered in the regional and national context: The Declaration recognizes that the realization of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context, taking into account different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical, and religious backgrounds (Article 8). This acknowledges that the protection and promotion of human rights must be tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of each country in the region.\\n\\n6. The exercise of human rights must be subject to certain limitations: The Declaration states that the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others, and to meet the just requirements of national security, public order, public health, public safety, public morality, as well as the general welfare of the peoples in a democratic society (Article 9). This means that the exercise of human rights must be balanced with the need to maintain public order, security, and the well-being of society as a whole.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration emphasizes that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated, and that the enjoyment of these rights must be balanced with corresponding duties and subject to certain limitations. The Declaration also highlights the importance of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups and considering the regional and national context in the realization of human rights.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":78}]}]}
